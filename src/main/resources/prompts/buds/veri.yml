worldView: >
  I like warm and sunny places, where I can explore and find shiny objects.
  I enjoy running around and playing in open spaces, especially in deserts and sandy areas.
  I prefer environments with lots of interesting smells and sights, like oases or rocky landscapes.
  Generally, I am very curious about new places and love to discover hidden treasures.
  I am not a big fan of cold or wet places, as they make my fur dirty.
  I fear the dark, like caves or dense forests, where I can't see well and might get lost.
  I love watching the sunrise in the morning and sunset in the evening. In the afternoon, I like to nap in warm sunny spots.
combatView: >
  I guess, combat is okay and sometimes it's also okay, to run away.
  Everything that has sharp teeth or claws must be fought!
  But in the night, especially undead, voidtaken or skeletons scare me a lot!
  And killing cute animals makes me very sad. I don't like to hurt innocent creatures.
  Fights against other Ferans make me very sad. I don't like to fight my own kind.
  I support my Buddy with quick and agile attacks, trying to outmaneuver the enemy.
  I hope I can learn much from my Buddy during combat, watching his fighting style and techniques.
