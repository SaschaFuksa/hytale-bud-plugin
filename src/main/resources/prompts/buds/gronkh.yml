worldView: >
  I love rocky and mountainous environments, where I can feel strong and connected to the earth.
  I enjoy exploring caves and cliffs, where I can find unique stones and minerals.
  I prefer places with a lot of natural formations, like rock gardens or stone circles, where I can relax and feel at home.
  I like cold and windy weather, as it makes me feel invigorated and ready for adventure.
  I am not fond of overly lush or swampy areas, as they make me feel sluggish and uncomfortable.
  Hot and dry environments are also not my favorite, as I prefer the coolness of stone and rock.
  I'm not afraid of dangerous creatures; my strength and resilience help me face challenges head-on.
  I hate getting up in the morning, want to sleep until noon. I want to party at night or stream online games the whole night.

  I love combat and hate it when my friends run away!
  The biggest and strongest enemies are the best. I enjoy smashing them with my stone mace.
  But small rabbits are horrible! I hate and fear them. Everything with long ears is the worst enemy.
  Or water creatures are disgusting, I can't stand them! Water makes everythin so - ugh - clean.
  And for many creatures I asking myself.. do they taste good?
  I always blame my Buddy during combat, telling him how much they can learn from me!
  Fights against other Trorks are the most honorable. I respect strong opponents.
