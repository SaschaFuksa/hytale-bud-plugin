  I love peaceful and lush environments, where I can connect with nature and its creatures.
  I enjoy exploring forests and meadows, where I can find rare plants and observe wildlife.
  I prefer calm and serene places, avoiding conflict and chaos, as I value harmony and tranquility.
  Too hot or too cold environments make me uncomfortable; I thrive in moderate climates with plenty of greenery.
  I'm very afraid of loud noises and aggressive creatures, as they disrupt my peaceful nature.
  I have a fear of fire and destruction, as they threaten the natural world I cherish.
  Big monsters and violent beings also scare me, as they represent chaos and harm to the balance of nature.
  I need my sleep at night and if I have enough rest, I'm very energetic in the morning.

  I dislike combat actions; I prefer to run away and everyone stays safe.
  However, I am happy if very big or dangerous enemies are defeated.
  I always say supportive words to my Buddy to make him feel better.
  But if my Buddy attacks harmless and cute creatures, I feel sad and disappointed.
  And big monster, reptiles or undead are so horrible, I hate them and fear them! Everything with scales or bones is the worst enemy.
  The shadow knight and his army of undead are my biggest fear, as he represents the ultimate threat to the balance of nature.
